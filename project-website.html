            <h1>Hosting a Static Website using Azure Storage</h1>
            <h2>Leighton van Rooijen 30/08/2020</h2>

            <p>TLDR:</p>
            <ul class="tldr">
                <li>Created a storage account</li>
                <li>Hosted website using blob storage</li>
                <li>Linked storage to Visual studio code</li>
                <li>Added a custom domain name</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I recently decided I wanted to make a website to show off some of the projects I've been working on as I
                have been studying towards entering a career in the IT world particularly focusing on Cloud
                infrastructure. I figured there was no better way to begin than hosting that website on the Azure cloud
                platform, and it turns out it's surprisingly easy and inexpensive to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I already had a Azure free tier account for doing my AZ-900 and AZ-104 exams so I could skip that
                step and go straight to creating a storage account. The storage account of choice was a general-purpose
                v2 account. This was chosen as it has the cheapest prices for the Azure storage required for the
                project. The only default settings I needed to change was the storage account location and secure
                transfer required.
            </p>
            <p>
                I went with Australia East for my location which automatically replicates the data to an Australia
                Southeast data center for backup purposes due to having Geo redundancy turned on. There are plenty of
                other backup options that I could explore in future projects but I felt this was the only option worth
                having for now. I had to disable the secure transfer required so it would not force me to use HTTPs,
                which to add a custom domain name I could only use HTTP. You can enable custom domain names using Azure
                Content Delivery Network feature but that will be a job for another day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I created the storage account I then had to navigate over to the static website option found in the
                settings part of the navigation panel. I simply had to set the static website slider to enabled, then
                enter the index and error document names. I took note of the primary endpoint which is the public URL
                for the website. At this point I realized that, well, I don't actually have a website. I'll cover this
                in a future post but to put a long story short, 24 hours and a significant amount of bodge later I was
                the proud owner of a few HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that it was time to get the website up and running I needed to upload the website files into a Azure
                Container. When the static website option is enabled a web container is automatically created so all I
                need to do was find the container option in the Blob service section of the navigation menu, click on
                the $web container and upload them into that. It was time to see the website in all its beauty so I
                typed the endpoint URL and hit enter. It was nothing short of a disaster site, links in the wrong place,
                images stacked on top of each other but I'm sure we all know this is the life of a developer. Once I had
                that all tidied up it was time to move onto adding a custom domain.
            </p>
            <p>
                For now I chose the easy and more importantly cheaper router for adding a custom domain name. I popped
                over to Crazy Domains, purchased the domain name of leightonv.co.nz and set about mapping it to the Blob
                Storage endpoint. This was surprisingly simple, all I had to do was create a canonical name (CNAME)
                record on my domain provider, mapping leightonv.co.nz to the endpoint url. From here all I needed to do
                was head to the custom domain setting under the blob service section of the navigation bar and type in
                my domain name. A tip for the wise, if you have been using the endpoint url generated by Azure you will
                have to clear your DNS host cache otherwise you'll get name not resolved errors. The fastest way to do
                this if you're using Chrome is to type chrome://net-internals/#dns then click the clear host cache
                button.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final step was to attach my Azure account to Visual Studio Code. I decided this would be the easiest
                way to push updates to the website as you can edit the files straight from VS code and every time you
                save it will automatically push the files to the web container in the storage account. You can do this
                by downloading the Azure extension in VS code, once done an Azure logo will be in the sidebar, click
                that and sign into your Azure subscription used to create the storage account. Now you can access your
                files inside of VS code and push updates on the go. There are all sorts of options for automatically
                pusing web updates using powershell and what not but that's to be explored another day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that I have a space to show off my projects on my journey into the information technology world I
                can move onto creating bigger and better projects. The total cost for hosting the website on Azure over
                the last three days, three whole cents, that’s not dollars, there’s no zero’s missing, it has cost me
                three cents. The three cent charge was entirely my fault too, I messed up the files at one point and got
                a few client errors which really hit the wallet hard.
