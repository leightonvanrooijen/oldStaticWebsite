            <h1>ARM Templates: Creating and Deploying an Azure Storage Account</h1>
            <h2>Leighton van Rooijen 11/09/2020</h2>
            <p>
                Now that we know why you should be using ARM templates I’ve decided to show off a super simple ARM
                template design and then deploy it using Powershell. Ideally you should be familiar with JSON before you
                start reading this but it’s not essential.
            </p>
            <p>
                To begin, open up Visual Studio Code and create a JSON file. I chose to call mine basic-armdeploy.json.
                The final template should be similar to this with a few changes:
            </p>
            <pre class="codebox">
                    <code>
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "resources": [
        {
        "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
        "apiVersion": "2019-04-01",
        "name": "historagehi",
        "location": "australia east",
        "sku": {
            "name": "Standard_LRS"
        },
        "kind": "StorageV2",
        "properties": {
            "supportsHttpsTrafficOnly": true
        }
        }
    ]
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>
                Copy and paste that code into VS code and then we can break down what each section means.
            </p>
            <p>
                Essential section:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>$schema </strong>- This points to the location of the JSON schema file. The schema file that
                    we point to has all of the deployment properties that are available within Azure.

                <li><strong>contentVersion </strong>- This is the version of the template. It’s not so important for us.
                    But when significant changes are made to the template you increase this number. If multiple people
                    are making deployments or updates the template with the highest number will be used. Alternatively,
                    if a template is deployed with a higher version number only templates with higher numbers can be
                    used to update it. This prevents accidental update rollbacks.

                <li><strong>resources </strong>- This contains the resources you want to deploy or update. In our case
                    it will contain the storage account.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Inside the resources section:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>type </strong>- This is the type of resource. This includes the resource provider. In our
                    case it is Microsoft.Storage and the type of resource from that provider is storageAccounts.

                <li><strong>apiVersion </strong>- This is the version number of the REST API to use for creating the
                    resource. This means that as the API updates and changes your code won’t break.

                <li><strong>name </strong>- Name of the resource. It has to be a universally unique storage name. Just
                    pick something random as we will delete it at the end. It’s common for deployments to fail because
                    everyone picks the same random names.

                <li><strong>location </strong>- Sets the region where the resource is deployed. Pick the one that is
                    closest to you.

                <li><strong>sku </strong>- This is the storage account type it has two properties:
                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>name </strong>- Which is the type of storage, in our case Locally Redundant Storage.

                        <li><strong>tier </strong>- premium or standard tier. Not required as we specified standard in
                            the name.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <li><strong>kind </strong>- This is the account kind. LRS supports storage, BlobStorage and StorageV2.
                    We are using StorageV2.

                <li><strong>properties </strong>- This is the parameters for the storage account. We have ensured only
                    HTTPs traffic is allowed. There's quite a few of these so explore them in your free time.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There’s a lot more to ARM Templates than the parameters I described above. Here’s a link that I would
                recommend exploring everytime you want to work out how to go about making a particular deployment.
                Structure and syntax of ARM templates: <a
                    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/template-syntax">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/template-syntax</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deploying the template using Powershell.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a pretty simple process and for now we will do it manually using Powershell but in the future we
                will explore automation of this process. To begin open up Powershell on your local machine and type sign
                into your Azure account using:<strong> Connect-AzAccount</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have a resource group you want to deploy to skip this step. Otherwise enter the following:
            </p>
            <pre class="codebox">
                    <code>
New-AzResourceGroup `
        -Name myResourceGroup `
    -Location "Central US"
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>
                To deploy the Arm template you need to know the location of the JSON template on your computer. The
                quickest way is to go to the file in your file explorer then right click the address and click copy as
                text then add the filename to the end of that. We will also save the path of the template file to a
                variable. Although not necessary it’s good practice to get into as it stops you having to retype the
                path for each deployment on large projects. Type the following into Powershell:
            </p>
            <pre class="codebox">
                <code >
$templateFile = "{provide-the-path-to-the-template-file}"
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
    -Name blanktemplate `
    -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
    -TemplateFile $templateFile
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                If you did everything correctly you should have a new storage account in the resource group you created.
                Navigate to Azure and check it out for yourself.
            </p>
