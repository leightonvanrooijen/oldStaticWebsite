            <h1>Leighton van Rooijen</h1>
            <h2>Cloud Focused IT Specialist</h2>
            
            <p>
                Leighton is a self starter whoâ€™s passion for the Tech industry led him into changing careers in 2020.
                Some would say 2020 was the worst time to change but for Leighton it was an opportunity to retool his
                toolbox and start pursuing passion over income. Tech has been a hobby of his since he was young. Much to
                his parents dismay he was often found taking apart electronic toys to get a peak at the inner workings
                from the age he could hold a screwdriver. When the household got its first computer his passion really
                took off. From that moment on he was either found roaming the farm or inside on the computer. The two
                polar opposite interests of outdoors and computers proved a unique challenge for Leighton when it came
                to picking a career path. After pursuing a career in the outdoors he decided his passion for the IT
                industry was stronger thus deciding to restudy.

            <p>
                After building multiple projects in his spare time Leighton decided that putting these projects out into
                the internet would be a mutually beneficial exercise. The internet would get more information in a fast
                developing industry and he would get to practice communicating his ideas to an audience, something he
                considers an area he could improve in. The website began as a way to understand HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript. He wanted to understand web design and the way data interacts with websites. From there it
                became a way to display projects on his journey to understanding specifics of IT systems.
